## Suitable for Beginners

* ★ Learn to Program ([PragProg](https://pragprog.com/titles/ltp3/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1680508172/))
    - Ideal for beginners to programming, not those switching from other languages.
* Beginning Ruby 3: From Beginner to Pro ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1484263235/))
    - Published 2020, Ruby 3.0 (but any version is suitable for these beginner topics)

## Intermediate

* Eloquent Ruby (Addison-Wesley) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321584104/))

* Black Hat Ruby ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JHSF6GT/))

    - This could be garbage. Haven't looked more closely.



## Books *in* Ruby, not specifically *about* Ruby

* ★ [Practical Object-Oriented Design](https://www.poodr.com), 2nd ed.; Sandi Metz ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134456475/))
* [99 Bottles of OOP, 2nd ed.](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles)
* Computer Science Programming Basics in Ruby ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449355978/))
* Data Structures and Algorithms in Ruby ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3F2BZ9M/))



## Reference, History

* The Ruby Way: Solutions and Techniques in Ruby Programming (Addison-Wesley) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321714636/))
    - 3rd edition published 2015, Ruby 2.1
    - ”This book is largely intended to answer questions of the form ‘How do I…?.’ As such, you can expect to do a lot of skipping around.” Sounds like what you're doing online already.
    - “As the second Ruby book in the English language (after *Programming Ruby*, by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt), *The Ruby Way* was designed to be complementary to that book rather than overlap with it; that is still true today.”
    - Certainly has history/nostalgia. If you get an old Pickaxe, get one of these to go with it.
* Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0 (The Pickaxe) ([PragProg]([Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0](https://pragprog.com/titles/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0-4th-edition/)), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937785491/))
    - Last updated 2013
    - Iconic. Used to be *the* Ruby book. I'm not sure why it was abandoned.
    - Pick up a used copy for $3 if you're inclined toward nostalgia.
* The Ruby Programming Language ([O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-ruby-programming/9780596516178/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0596516177/))
    - Published 2008, Ruby 1.8 and 1.9. *Ruby in a Nutshell* was expanded and updated into this book.
    - It's (co)written by Matz and the basics don't change. Worth a spot on the shelf.



## Meh

* Ruby Beginner's Crash Course ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1777942802/))
    - No author name, reviews, preview? No thanks.
* Ruby Programming for Beginners ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08992KQLH/))
    - (Self-)Published 2020, Ruby 2.6
* Comprehensive Ruby Programming ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787280640/))
    - Published 2017, Ruby 2.3
    - Almost no (and low at that) reviews when new.
* Ruby Pocket Reference (O'Reilly) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491926015/))
    - Published 2015, Ruby 2.2
* Ruby Cookbook: Recipes for Object-Oriented Scripting (O'Reilly) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449373712/))
    - Published 2015, Ruby 2.1
    - No reviews to speak of even when it was new.
* Head First Ruby ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449372651/))
    - Published 2015, Ruby 2.0
    - It's one of those books that came out when Ruby was booming but the publisher has since moved on. Reviews were decent but it's by no means iconic. If you just *loved* the Head First series and want to pick up a used copy to get started, ok.
* The Book of Ruby: A Hands-On Guide for the Adventurous ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593272944/))
    - Published 2011, Ruby 1.8, 1.9
    - Mixed (and few) reviews even when it was new.
