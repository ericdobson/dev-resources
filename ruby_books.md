## Suitable for Beginners

* ★ Learn to Program ([PragProg](https://pragprog.com/titles/ltp3/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1680508172/))
    - Ideal for beginners to programming, not those switching from other languages.
* I Love Ruby ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1796378429/))
    - Book on Amazon was published 2019, Ruby 2.5
    - Latest version [available online for free](https://i-love-ruby.gitlab.io), Ruby 3.0
    - I haven't yet reviewed for quality/usefulness/comparison to other sources.
* Beginning Ruby 3: From Beginner to Pro ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1484263235/))
    - Published 2020, Ruby 3.0 (but any version is suitable for these beginner topics)
* The Well-Grounded Rubyist, 3rd ed. ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617295213/))
    - 2019, “Updated for Ruby 2.5”
    - Beginner+
* The Little Book Of Ruby Programming ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913132072/))
    - Very beginner
* Learn Ruby the Hard Way ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/032188499X/))
    - Published 2014
    - Style isn't for everyone. Luckily it's [free to read online](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/). If you like it, $30 for a PDF and accompanying videos.



## Intermediate

* **Ruby Performance Optimization** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1680500694/))
    - Published 2015, Ruby 2.2
    - How much of this still applies? Browse chapter one for free. Run the code using the latest Ruby. Decide for yourself if there's still value here.
* **Effective Ruby: 48 Specific Ways to Write Better Ruby** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0133846970/))
    - Published 2014, Ruby 1.9.3, 2.1, etc. (not picky)
    - Another book focused on settling in to quality, idiomatic Ruby. It covers Ruby more generally, not focused on a specific (now outdated) version. It's published by Addison-Wesley (generally high quality). Seems worth a look.
* **Confident Ruby: 32 Patterns for Joyful Coding** ([Author](https://avdi.codes/books/), [PragProg](https://pragprog.com/titles/agcr/confident-ruby/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ETE0D2S/))
    - Published 2013
    - That Sandi Metz wrote the foreword is all I needed to know.
* **Ruby Under a Microscope** ([Author](https://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope), [Publisher](https://nostarch.com/rum), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593275277/))
    - Published 2013
    - This book somewhat defies beginning/intermediate/advanced categorization. In a way it's better to consider what level you aspire to, rather than where you're at. This is best suited to those who aspire to advanced/expert Ruby. But you could start reading it once you're functional past the most beginner level.
    - Or consider how you tend to think about things. If understanding the underlying *why* makes it much easier for you to learn the *how*, this is for you. If others were grinding gears and burning the clutch while you were sitting down to first read about how manual transmissions work, yes again.
* **Exceptional Ruby: Master the Art of Handling Failure in Ruby** ([Author](https://avdi.codes/books/), [PragProg](https://pragprog.com/titles/ager/exceptional-ruby/))
    - Published 2011
* **Eloquent Ruby** (Addison-Wesley) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321584104/))
    - Published 2011, Ruby 1.9
    - Progress beyond “correct” code to idiomatic Ruby.
* **Refactoring: Ruby Edition** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321984137/))
    - Published 2009, Ruby version doesn't matter.
    - Should you get this? Here's a summary:
        - Even in this book they say you probably don't need this if you have the original (when only the first edition was out, written in Java) unless you found the Java to be too much of an obstacle. If only the first version of the original were out, and you didn't own it, then of course why not get the Ruby version?
        - But now the [2nd edition (2018)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134757599/) is out, and it uses JavaScript, specifically to make it as accessible to as many people as possible. They specifically say you don't need to know JavaScript to get the point and apply the concepts to any language.
        - So that's the tradeoff: A more recent version in JavaScript, or the older version in Ruby. I think your preference is what matters most. The important thing is to learn the underlying concepts.
        - Now that I think about it, the Ruby version is as cheap as two dollars, and it's in Ruby. Get it and move on.
* Design Patterns in Ruby ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321490452/))
    - Published 2007
    - Don't get the Kindle version. Consistent comments about poor code formatting.



## Advanced, Specialty

* Polished Ruby Programming ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1801072728/))
* Black Hat Ruby ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JHSF6GT/))
    - Published 2020, Ruby v?, aimed at security pros
    - This could be garbage. Haven't looked more closely.



## Books *in* Ruby, not specifically *about* Ruby

* ★ [Practical Object-Oriented Design](https://www.poodr.com), 2nd ed.; Sandi Metz ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134456475/))
* [99 Bottles of OOP, 2nd ed.](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles)
* Computer Science Programming Basics in Ruby ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449355978/))
* Data Structures and Algorithms in Ruby ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3F2BZ9M/))



## Reference, History

* **The Ruby Way: Solutions and Techniques in Ruby Programming** (Addison-Wesley) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321714636/))
    - 3rd edition published 2015, Ruby 2.1
    - ”This book is largely intended to answer questions of the form ‘How do I…?.’ As such, you can expect to do a lot of skipping around.” Sounds like what you're doing online already.
    - “As the second Ruby book in the English language (after *Programming Ruby*, by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt), *The Ruby Way* was designed to be complementary to that book rather than overlap with it; that is still true today.”
    - Certainly has history/nostalgia. If you get an old Pickaxe, get one of these to go with it.
* **Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0** (The Pickaxe) ([PragProg]([Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0](https://pragprog.com/titles/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0-4th-edition/)), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1937785491/))
    - Last updated 2013
    - Iconic. Used to be *the* Ruby book. I'm not sure why it was abandoned.
    - Pick up a used copy for $3 if you're inclined toward nostalgia.
* **The Ruby Programming Language** ([O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-ruby-programming/9780596516178/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0596516177/))
    - Published 2008, Ruby 1.8 and 1.9. *Ruby in a Nutshell* was expanded and updated into this book.
    - It's (co)written by Matz and the basics don't change. Worth a spot on the shelf.



## Meh (or just outdated)

* Ruby Beginner's Crash Course ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1777942802/))
    - No author name, reviews, preview? No thanks.
* Ruby Programming for Beginners ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08992KQLH/))
    - (Self-)Published 2020, Ruby 2.6
* Comprehensive Ruby Programming ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787280640/))
    - Published 2017, Ruby 2.3
    - Almost no (and low at that) reviews when new.
* Ruby For Beginners (iCode Academy) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1521367701/))
    - Published 2017, Ruby 1.9.3 & up recommended, for complete beginners.
    - A series iCode Academy played with publishing in 2017 and then abandoned. I'm not sure how they could've jammed one more Ruby Programming SEO keyword on the back cover.
* Intro To Ruby Programming ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0692714413/))
    - Published 2016, Ruby v?, for total beginners
    - An outdated attempt at boosting the author's lifestyle business. No thanks.
* Ruby Pocket Reference (O'Reilly) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491926015/))
    - Published 2015, Ruby 2.2
* Ruby Cookbook: Recipes for Object-Oriented Scripting (O'Reilly) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449373712/))

* Head First Ruby ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449372651/))
    - Published 2015, Ruby 2.0
    - It's one of those books that came out when Ruby was booming but the publisher has since moved on. Reviews were decent but it's by no means iconic. If you just *loved* the Head First series and want to pick up a used copy to get started, ok.
* Ruby Wizardry: An Introduction to Programming for Kids ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593275668/))
    - Published 2014, Ruby 2.0
    - Interesting approach.
* Ruby Quick Syntax Reference ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/143026568X/))
    - Published 2014
* The Book of Ruby: A Hands-On Guide for the Adventurous ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593272944/))
