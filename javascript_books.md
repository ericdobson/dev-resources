# JavaScript Books

I've not begun to compile a full list. Anything written here is just a lead for future research.

* **How JavaScript Works** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1949815005/))
    - Published 2018. By Douglas Crockford, creator of the JSON format, author of [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0596517742/).
    - Author's opinion from a [July, 2022 Q&A](https://www.crockford.com/qa2.html): JavaScript should be retired for something better.
    - This is a fairly recent book by the creator of JSON, a master of JavaScript, a senior JavaScript architect at PayPal until 2019â€¦ Who better to learn about JavaScript from than someone who has been both an expert of its every detail and public critic of its shortcomings for twenty-five years?
